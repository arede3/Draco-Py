# Draco-Py
Draco-Py is a library that allows users to solve problems from physics, chemistry, engineering, business, and mathematics. It utilizes the best math and statistics libraries in Python as well as physics-solvers to get solutions for problems in applied science and mathematics. You can visit the website at: https://arede3.github.io/Draco-Py/.
Currently supporting robotics libraries with linear algebra and basic probability and combinatorics support. Still in development, please come back after summer for a more complete set of problem solvers. Since my PhD is in robotics, open-source development will begin with robotics, machine learning, and related fields.
